Website Sale Wishlist Extended
==============================
This module allows to make items in the wish list do not disappear from the list after being added to the cart.

Usage
-----
As a logged in user (with access to E-commerce), I add an item to my wishlist.
I access my wishlist and I notice that the `Add product to my cart but keep it in my wishlist` checkbox is no longer displayed.

When I click on “Add to cart”, I see that the item has not disappeared from my list.
